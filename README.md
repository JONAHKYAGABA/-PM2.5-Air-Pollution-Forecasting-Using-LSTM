# 🌫️ PM2.5 Air Pollution Forecasting Using LSTM

This project implements an **LSTM-based deep learning model** using Keras and TensorFlow to predict air pollution levels (PM2.5). It preprocesses time-series data, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and exports it for deployment in `.h5` and `.tflite` formats.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and preprocess PM2.5 time-series data
- Train an LSTM model for time-series prediction
- Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE
- Visualize predictions vs actual values
- Export the model for embedded deployment using TensorFlow Lite
